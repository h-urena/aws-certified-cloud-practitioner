# AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Study Notes

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification study notes repository. This repo contains all the notes I've taken
while preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam (passed in Jan/2024).
These notes are based on the Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course, provided by Stephane Maarek, as per January
of 2024.

## About the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification

As per AWS official page: The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS
Cloud, services, and terminology.  This is a good starting point on the AWS Certification journey for individuals with no
prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career or for line-of-business employees looking for foundational cloud literacy.
